/*
git init - initializes the git
git add - adding the files which we want to save
    A file is being saved in the staging area - a file that stores info about what will go to the next commit
        git add 'specific file'
        git add .

git commit -m "main message" -m "additional info"
    -m "additional info" is not necessary

git status - looking at the status of files(e.g. what is added to the next commit)



git log - history of commits

git checkout 'commit code' - going to the chosen commit. We are at a different branch now

git branch - the list of branches




GitHub(GitLab, BitBucket) is a website where we can put our code on the Internet and other people can work on it, too
In order to publish code to GitHub, we should create a repository there
There are instructions on GitHub about how to hook up a folder on a local machine to the repository

git remote add origin 'https link' - hooking up to the website, giving the link a different name(origin)
git remote origin 'name of the branch' - pushing commit to the website

by default all the code is on the main branch(earlier it was master branch)


git branch 'name of new branch' - creating new branch
git checkout -b new-branch - creating new branch and going to it

git branch -d 'name of branch' - deleting a branch


git push origin 'name of branch' - pushing the changes to GitHub to the branch with that name

git pull origin 'name of branch' - pulling the files from GitHub with the branch name
